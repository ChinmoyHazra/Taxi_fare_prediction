# Taxi_fare_prediction
This data science project for how to build a Taxi Fare Prediction. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using automati dataset from kaggle.com.During model building we will concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers.

Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
xgboost for machine learing model
Jupyter notebook, visual studio code and pycharm as IDE
